This program controls a [Tattiebogle CD simulator](https://shop.tattiebogle.net/product/prod_EkTnv3Tk2Trxhf).

This was written to run on PC-98 hardware but will likely also work on regular IBM PC compatibles.

You'll need [OpenWatcom 2.x](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2) (1.x may work but has not been tested) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.26 to build.
